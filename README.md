## Don't Leave Me Hanging: A project by Timothy Tjen and Ineke Scheffers @ NYCDA
##### A webapp that lets you high five someone anywhere in the world. ‘Cause why the hell not?
Nobody wants to be left hanging when they’re hollaing for a high five. With this app you’re not dependent on people in the same room anymore. ‘Cause fuck’em. Now, the whole world can give you some love.

This app is for awesome people with frequent awesome moments that need awesome high fives, that should be responded to with awesome high fives and not be left hanging ‘cause there’s no one around to give some love. That’s so not awesome.
